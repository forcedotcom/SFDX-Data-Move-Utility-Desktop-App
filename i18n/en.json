  "TIPS": {
    "CONFIGURATION_STEP_INTRODUCTION": "In the {{ APP_NAME }}, the Configuration step enables you to create and manage your export.json configurations. Below is an overview of this process:\n\n- The Configuration step allows you to create multiple export.json configurations under the selected Workspace, facilitating the accomplishment of dedicated migration goals.\n- Use the main \"Configuration\" menu to create, rename, delete, and select configurations.\n- Each configuration corresponds to an independent export.json file, which contains multiple object sets.\n- Manage multiple object sets under the selected configuration by creating, renaming, reordering, or deleting them.\n- After creating and selecting an Object Set, add the necessary sObjects into the selected object set. Perform operations such as adding, removing, and other modifications on the selected sObjects in the selected object set by selecting them using the checkboxes next to each sObject.\n- Each sObject has its own settings, which can be defined using the Object Manager interface. Select the sObject you want to edit by clicking on the select button, then configure it.\n- To proceed to the next step, ensure that your configuration is correct and free of any issues.",
    "CONNECTION_STEP_INTRODUCTION": "Continuing on, the next step in the {{ APP_NAME }} involves establishing a connection. Here's what you need to understand:\n\n- The Connection step allows you to connect to both the data source and data target. It's important to connect in order to retrieve the metadata definition, which is then used to configure sObjects in the configuration.\n- You should run detection of available local SFDX connections using the main menu item labeled \"Connection\".\n- After detecting connections, you need to select both the data source and target. Once you've done this, you're ready to proceed to the next step.",
    "PREVIEW_STEP_INTRODUCTION": "In {{ APP_NAME }}, the Script Preview step is your last check before starting data migration. At this stage:\n\n- Use the **Script Preview** tab to ensure the script is correct and matches your goals.\n- Go to **Command Line Setup** to adjust CLI command flags as needed.\n- If you're happy with the script and its details, proceed to execution. For any discrepancies or concerns, revisit the Configuration step for adjustments.",
    "RUN_STEP_INTRODUCTION": "In the {{ APP_NAME }}, the Run step is where you kick off your data migration tasks. Here's what you can do at this stage:\n- **Click on 'Run the Script' button** to initiate the execution.\n- The execution will be performed in an external Terminal/Console window, which will open once the button is clicked.",
    "WORKSPACE_STEP_INTRODUCTION": "In the {{ APP_NAME }}, managing your workspace is the first crucial step of a five-step process that simplifies your migration tasks. You'll see a wizard that indicates your progress through these steps. You can navigate through the steps forward and backward using the provided buttons. For your convenience, the wizard area can be expanded or collapsed to save screen space.\n\nHere's what you need to know about managing your workspace:\n\n- Workspace is an entity that allows you to group several `export.json` configurations for independent purposes.\n- There's no limit to the number of workspaces you can have.\n- You can create, rename, select the active workspace, and delete workspaces using the main menu item labeled \"Workspace\".\n- Before you can proceed to the next step, you must create and select a workspace. This workspace will be used as a holder for the configurations you will manage in the subsequent Configuration steps.\n\nWhile navigating through the steps, you will encounter several types of icons that indicate the status of the current step:\n\n- A flag icon indicates required actions.\n- An exclamation triangle indicates issues that should be resolved to move to the next step.\n- A thumbs up icon indicates that this step is completed, and you can move to the next step.\nYou can hover your mouse over these icons to see a popover with details.\n\nPlease note that the application performs only partial error detection and sometimes marks a step as completed even though there are undetected errors. Therefore, it is always advisable to make an additional verification and ensure everything is correct before moving on to the next step."
