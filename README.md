The Salesforce Data Move Utility (SFDMU) is a robust SFDX Plugin crafted to enhance the data migration process across Salesforce environmentsâ€”be it scratch, development, sandbox, or production. It enables seamless operations like Delete, Insert, Update, and Upsert across multiple related sObjects, improving both the efficiency and accuracy of migrations.

### Application Overview

This user-friendly desktop application is instrumental in creating SFDMU plugin configuration files. With its intuitive user interface, the application simplifies configuring migration tasks, allowing users to focus more on the data rather than on complex file setups.

### Application Benefits

The `export.json` file central to SFDMU setups contains advanced properties critical for complex migrations. As migrations grow in complexity, manually editing these JSON files becomes challenging. This desktop application eliminates the reliance on basic tools like Notepad, enabling users to manage migrations visually. Users can easily add or remove org connections, configure sObjects and fields, and launch migrations directly within the app, enhancing efficiency and reducing errors.

### Transitioning to Version 4

We are thrilled to introduce version 4 of the SFDMU GUI App. Users upgrading from previous versions should review the new enhancements and critical changes to ensure a smooth transition. This upgrade is designed to streamline your migration processes further, enhancing user experience and task execution.

Upgrade to the latest version of the SFDMU application for a more efficient and user-friendly data migration experience across your Salesforce orgs.
